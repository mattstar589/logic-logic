code explanation in simplest form.  this is what th code does in its simplest form. its make top and bot lines that uses an ema. and we made 4 more lines. one above and one below top and bot. and we trade off those lines. but we dont want to make trades or exit them when the lines are not straight, so we make sure the lines are straight or horizontal for touches trades and exits to count. when there is a trade or exit, there is a label that says what happened. buy trade. buy label. and i want a notification. so that is the alert system. but pinescript is realy bad at just detetcing trade by touches. so what is equal to a touch ina  2d plane. being = to it. that were the dashboard comes in. it trackes the real time prices of the market price and the 6 lines. since i dont want to trade the close of the bar, we use real time for ema, horizontal and dahsboard. so when top price is = to market price, the code has a very cut and clean way to see or know or detect that, that is a touch.  and do this indaviduallt for any and all markets that i add to the code, so each market is seperate from one another, even if they have the same rouchinf value. that is the most simpest form there is. but we talk about the little details that very very much matter. the exact touch trade and exit logic. the intrade and flag logic. that needs to be exactly the way i want it. the dashboard need to track all markets market price and lines on every tick. there is still a lot in this. that why forgetting is teribble, but i made a paste link that has out entiore convosation. and before you answer any question. you look into that paste link. and read our convo. and remember its a convo ntk a fact book, since its in their doesnt mean it right. like. i asked for all the key points you showed me 8. they he asked again and i named 12 and he said correct. so the next time he askes for key point i show him the 12 he said yes to not the 8. ok he want me to add these 3 thongs to the code. so i will add them too the 12 key points. i know your an ai but you still can think, and desifer. .   key points. . .

Purpose: Tracks the state of touches and trades.
Details:
Flags (topFlag, botFlag) indicate whether a price level has been touched.
inTrade determines if a trade is active.
Logic:
Flags turn ON after main touches and OFF after little range trades.
inTrade turns ON when a trade starts and resets OFF after an exit.
Dashboard Enhancements:

Purpose: Displays critical real-time information visually on the chart.
Details:
Includes market-specific levels, the current market price, and the status of flags and trades.
Updates dynamically in real time.
Exit Logic:

Purpose: Exits trades systematically when specified conditions are met.
Details:
Exits when the price returns to a main level (top or bot).
Includes handling for price skipping scenarios based on trade direction.
EMA (Exponential Moving Average):

Purpose: Dynamically calculates smoothed price levels for market boundaries.
Details:
The foundation for determining top and bot levels.
Calculations use the EMA of the selected market.
Multi-Market Support:

Purpose: Allows the strategy to work across different markets.
Details:
Includes market-specific rounding for price levels.
User selects the market via input options.
Little Range Levels:

Purpose: Provides finer-grained levels around main lines for more precise trades.
Details:
Divides the gap between top and bot into smaller fractions.
Adds levels like htop, ltop, hbot, lbot.
Horizontal Lines:

Purpose: Visually plots all calculated levels on the chart.
Details:
Main lines (top, bot) and little ranges (htop, ltop, hbot, lbot) are displayed.
Labels:

Purpose: Marks significant events (touches, trades, exits) on the chart.
Details:
Each event (e.g., "Top Buy", "Bot Touch") is labeled with text and color.
Alerts:

Purpose: Sends real-time notifications for significant events.
Details:
Alerts are triggered for touches, trades, and exits.
Touch Logic:

Purpose: Detects when the market price touches key levels.
Details:
Activates flags (topFlag, botFlag) when a touch occurs.
Creates labels and triggers alerts.
Trade Logic:

Purpose: Executes trades based on price interactions with little range levels.
Details:
Trades include "Top Buy", "Top Sell", "Bot Buy", and "Bot Sell".
Flags are reset after a trade.
Real-Time Execution:

Purpose: Ensures continuous updates and immediate reactions to market changes.
Details:
Logic runs in real time on each price tick.
Three Additions
Dashboard Enhancements:

Added Elements:
Flag Status Indicators: Shows whether topFlag or botFlag is ON or OFF.
InTrade Status and Trade Type: Displays whether a trade is active and the type of trade.
Skip Exit Logic (Directional Exit Logic):

Added Behavior:
Allows trades to remain active when the price skips an exit level in the direction of profit.
Exits immediately if the price skips an exit level in the direction of loss.
Exits normally when the price touches the exit level.
Clarified Flag and InTrade Reset Logic:

Added Details:
Flags reset after little range touches.
inTrade resets when the price exits an active trade.
Ensures proper state transitions for flags and trades.. these are the 13 key points and three additions. more about the additions and some questions that are true when the code is made. Adjusted Logic
For Buy Trades:

If the price skips upwards (in the direction of profit), do nothing and let the trade continue.
If the price skips downwards (in the direction of loss or the direction the trade was made), exit the trade immediately.
For Sell Trades:

If the price skips downwards (in the direction of profit), do nothing and let the trade continue.
If the price skips upwards (in the direction of loss or the direction the trade was made), exit the trade immediately.
General Exit Rules:

If the price returns to the intended exit level (e.g., the last known profit/loss level), exit the trade normally.
Code Implementation
Below is the updated code snippet implementing this logic:


price_movement_exit_logic.pine
// Directional Exit Logic Based on Price Movement
var float lastTradePrice = na                // Store the price where the trade started
var bool tradeDirectionUp = na               // Determine trade direction (true = upward, false = downward)

// Set Direction on Trade Start
if inTrade and na(tradeDirectionUp)
How This Implements the Logic
Tracks Trade Direction:

The tradeDirectionUp variable determines whether the trade is moving upward (Buy) or downward (Sell).
It is set when a trade starts and updated dynamically.
Exits on Loss Direction:

For a Buy Trade:
If the price drops below lastTradePrice (direction of loss), the trade exits immediately.
For a Sell Trade:
If the price rises above lastTradePrice (direction of loss), the trade exits immediately.
Skips in Profit Direction:

The code does nothing if:
The price moves up for a Buy Trade (profit direction).
The price moves down for a Sell Trade (profit direction).
No Reliance on Top or Bot:

The logic now depends only on lastTradePrice and the price movement relative to it.
This ensures the system dynamically adapts to changing levels without confusion about what constitutes top or bot.
Normal Exits:

When the price reaches the intended exit level (e.g., closes at a level of profit/loss), the trade exits normally.
Example Scenarios
Scenario 1: Buy Trade
Trade Start:
A Buy Trade starts at lastTradePrice = 615.
Price Movement:
Price moves to 620: Do nothing (profit direction).
Price moves to 610: Exit immediately (loss direction).
Scenario 2: Sell Trade
Trade Start:
A Sell Trade starts at lastTradePrice = 600.
Price Movement:
Price moves to 590: Do nothing (profit direction).
Price moves to 605: Exit immediately (loss direction).
Summary
This adjusted logic:

Tracks the trade direction (up for Buy, down for Sell).
Exits immediately if the price skips in the direction of loss (opposite of profit).
Allows trades to continue if the price skips in the direction of profit.
Removes reliance on fixed levels like top and bot, making it adaptable to any market condition.
Let me know if you'd like further clarifications or additional examples!

You said: so for skipps. it uses lasttradeprice.
 so for skipps. it uses lasttradeprice. but with all trades. if they touch top or bot that is still an exit. id so just say yes
Copilot said: Yes.
Yes.

You said: if correct say yes. if a trade
if correct say yes. if a trade exit of a skip. the flah still turn on and intrade turns off
Copilot said: Yes.
Yes.

You said: id correct just say yes. can you
id correct just say yes. can you look back in out convo. from this message and everty message to the latest one. "lets reset. and properly reset. like to step one. what is the code or trading strategy trying to do.  be very broad. but answer that question many times. like. to make labels and alert for a strategy. and keep going more specif, then eventually talking about each key point"
Copilot said: Yes.
Yes..this exact trade logic. this logic needs to be transfered into code form.  this is the logic the code needs to use. when i say flag, i mean there was a top or bot touch. here is the logic for top and bot touches, the 4 
ades and exits. top touch, if top horizontal and market price = to top price, top touch, top touch label, and turn on flag.   bot touch, if 
tbot horizontal and market price = to bot price, bot touch, bot touch label, and turn on flag. top buy, if flag is on, and top is hroizontal and m
arket price = to htop price, buh trade, top buy trade label, turn flag off.   top sell, if flag is on, and top is hroizontal and market price = to ltop p
rice, sell trade, top sell trade label, turn flag off.          bot buy, if flag is on
, and bot is hroizontal and market price = to hbot price, buy trade, bot buy trade label, turn flag off.    
    bot sell, if flag is on, and bot is hroizontal and market price = to lbot price, sell trade, bot sell trade label, turn flag off.    
exit for all trades. if in trade, and top is horizontal, if market price = to top or bot price, exi trade, exit trade label,
 and turn flag on. everything is real time. remember you cant use ifhorizontal in the code but this is the
 logic, you know how to change the code but have the same logic. so what you should know now is. what the code is trying to acheive. all of the key points in the code. any little details. im going to say a little more. if any this in not in this direct message that contradicts what i say, listent to me and change or add. there are several conditions for a touch, trade and exit to count. and you know all of the conditions already. but the univeral condition is if the top and bot is horizontal. the code should be tracking if the lines are horizontal. so trades touches and exit will not count if they touch a non horizontal line, or i say an angled line. for example. there is a bot touch, then price moves up and =hbot, then check if hbot is horizontal, if so its a trade, if not there is no trade, and the bot touch flag turnes off. this is propally new logic. for exit. if there was a bot buy trade, and it goes up and touches an angled top line, no exit, trade stays on. alerts should bemade by labels. when there is a top sell label, i will then get a notification saying"top sell". this goes for the two touchs, all 4 trades and exit.THIS IS IMPORTANT the trading strategy should use the real time tracking of the dashboard to detect touchs trades and exits. i know pinesfript is really bad at detecting touches. so we will use the dashboard for that. and if everything is being tracked in real time, if top  is = to the market price, that has to be a touch. the dahsboard need to track all of these for all markets, but each market is seperate from one another. so if im on appl i should only see appl's prices. what the dashbaord should track. this is all real time or on every tick. the market price, top and bot,toph,topl,both,botl and is intrade is on and if the top or bot flag is on. this is detailed bit core logic. nothing can change. no making trades on closes, no tolerence, all needs to be exactly how i explain. as you know there is like 14 markets, with some rounding values being the same , but they are all seperate. i should also be getting labels and alerts from all markets.
